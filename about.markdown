I'm a physicist turned machine learning engineer. Currently at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), I use machine learning and optimization to drive efficiency in our marketplaces. Previously at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com), I worked on modeling graph entities at scale and multi-objective optimization in mixed-time horizon applications in the context of our communications eco-system.
