The view _from_ the top is the topic of many a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00JT8K39C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1), [speaker series](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/learning/guest-speakers/view-top), [magazine feature](https://www.forbes.com/views-from-the-top/#4a83328c4b81), [consulting](report), blog post, tweet, and virtually every other form of media.

On the other hand, how employees view the managers that at the top and what they take away from their interactions with them have not been discussed in much detail. It should be no surprise that, all things being equal, people prefer to work under, say, a VP, whose judgment they trust.

My experience is that front-line members of the organization are judging those senior leaders, but I'm not sure those senior leaders are aware (or remember from their time as junior members) that they are being judged. Which is to say, I think some of them would do things differently if they thought about their actions through the lens of their junior reports.

What I want to explore is how/when employees are building their opinions and what they're taking away from things they see. There ended up being too much to cover in a single post, so in this one I'm going to talk about one of those stalwarts of leadership communication - the all-hands meeting. In future posts, I'll discuss the other aspects that influence people's opinion of their upper management.

## Who is going to win the Winter Olympics?

I learned before the PyeongChang Winter Olympics that one of the forms of fantasy sports pools people play is to draft countries before the Olympics start and then you get points for every medal the country wins (obviously, different points for gold, silver, bronze).

Since the Winter Olympics is every four years, and a lot of the sports are not very well publicized in the off years, a common strategy is to look at how a given country did four years ago and make your draft ranking according to that. That strategy might not be the best you can do, as many of the competitors will be different from four years ago, but the advantage is that the information is readily available.

When trying to understand the quality of their senior leaders, employees face a similar challenge. They rarely, if ever, have the opportunity to meet the senior leaders in a small group where they can have personal interactions on which to base their opinion. That leaves opportunities which might be more frequent, but less valuable, including the well known all-hands meeting.

## The All-Hands Conundrum

For some people, planning an all-hands meeting probably seems like a "you're damned if you do, damned if you don't" scenario. If you don't have all-hands meetings ever, people will wonder why you aren't willing to show your face to the masses. But on the other hand, a bad all-hands will have people wondering why you wasted everyone's time. So far, the only regular all-hands that I go to that is usually good, either in tech or the equivalent in academia, is the LinkedIn company all-hands, which happens every two weeks. But to be fair to everyone else, that's also the only all-hands with its own budget.

The all-hands meeting represents an important chance for employees to get a look at a senior leader's thought process and also to get answers to questions they think are important.

However, I think it's fair to say the all-hands meeting has a much larger down-side than up-side. If your all-hands goes off perfectly, then employees probably leave happy it wasn't a waste of time and in agreement with whatever was presented. If things go poorly, employees can leave with opinions anywhere from "another wasted hour" to "oh my god, our VP is an idiot."

We had one all-hands where the VP running the meeting made weird references to his boss every few minutes. I'm not sure if it was an inside joke between the senior leaders, but it was strange enough to distract from whatever point he was trying to make, so much so that all I remember about that meeting is those weird references.

If you have a bad or strange performance in a single meeting, that might be overlooked by people who know you well, but for people who barely know you at all, it will likely be taken as a signal about your personality. 

## Strategic Vision

It's pretty common for all-hands meetings to include a section rolling out a new strategy that someone is going to work on. This section of the meeting is where employees are judging their senior leader's decision-making, by thinking about questions like:

- Does this strategy addresses an important problem?
- Is this strategy the best way to tackle the important problem?
- Are there other problems we should be tackling first?

*Your employees are sharp, they are experts in the problems that the company is solving, and they are going to see the strengths and weaknesses of any arguments that are being made.*

We see things going wrong in a lot of ways. The most common pattern is that the thing being presented [is it's just a goal](https://hbr.org/2017/11/many-strategies-fail-because-theyre-not-actually-strategies). Wanting to improve the product experience is a goal. Wanting to increase some metric by X% is a goal.

If your goal is concrete, like increase the metric by X%, is the goal reasonable? One of the major strategic goals we learned about a couple of years ago at LinkedIn was to increase daily active users (DAUs) by a large amount. The strategy to achieve this goal was to increase another metric, which was shown to have a causal relation with DAUs. The justification for following this strategy was simply extrapolating that result from the low values seen in the causal study to the large values that were desired. So a lot of people were worried that this plan may not play out very well, and those worries have largely been justified.

## Question/Answer

Most all-hands meetings that I've been to conclude with an Q&A session. One of the great improvements we've seen lately is the transition from questions being sourced first-come, first-serve from the meeting room mic to using an app that allows audience members to submit questions, sometimes anonymously, and then the audience can vote during the meeting.

Allowing audience members to vote means that questions relevant or interesting to a higher fraction are more likely to be asked. That does mean that you, personally, may not be able to get a question answered that you're very interested in. Anonymous question asking does allow "harder" questions to get asked, since you don't have to risk the ire of the big boss.

When questions are asked first-come, first-serve, there can be a lot more variance in the usefulness of the questions, as the askers are only representing their own interests. Also, having to ask your question in person selects for certain personality types, limiting access for less vocal team members.

Answering questions, of course, is a key component to any good Q&A session and major window that employees have in seeing how management think, both in general and about specific issues.

Generally, people like to see concise, no-bullshit answers to questions. Getting through lots of questions with clear answers is definitely preferable to only getting through a few questions, but adding lots of explanation. Explanations only add value if they contain additional information.

Unfortunately, there are plenty of ways for Q&A sessions to go wrong beyond meandering, time-wasting answers. One that I've seen a few times is disparaging the question. Of course, not all questions are going to be great, whether they're asked in person or anonymously, but it's never a good idea to imply the question isn't good. After all, at least one person thought it was important enough to ask.

I remember one all-hands meeting where a question was submitted anonymously asking whether compensation in a specific team was too low. It was the most highly upvoted question, so it got asked first. Clearly, people cared about getting an answer. The VP running the meeting started his answer by saying the question wasn't very good and that this wasn't the appropriate venue for the question, and somewhat facetiously telling the team manager to take care of his team, before giving an answer along the lines of "we think we're competitive." The same question came up the very next all-hands, and the answer was pretty much the same.

As someone who's not a member of that team, I'm not that interested in whether their compensation, specifically, is competitive, but I am very interested in how the management understands the compensation landscape and their attitude towards maintaining competitive compensation for current employees. So I think the question is pretty relevant to a lot of people. Undermining the values of the employees and following up with a pretty much non-answer doesn't reflect very well on the executive giving the answers here.

## Conclusions
The all-hands meeting is a common communication device used by executives to get their messages out to their teams, but as an opportunity to shape their employees' opinion of them, it's high-risk, low-reward.

Executives can come through looking good when they keep everything concise and remember that the whole affair is being viewed with a critical eye.
