Welcome to my inaugural blog post! I don't plan to limit the focus of the blog to a specific set of topics, but to start out I'll be primarily writing about machine learning and life in the tech industry.

The first arc I have in mind are some thoughts on management from the point of view of a non-manager. Most of the blogs, books, articles, etc. on management are written by or about people with extensive management experience. Not that I don't think they have good things to say, but it seems like there should be some more voices from the side of the managed. Though I've been a project leader / tech lead, I've never been a people manager.

To kick it off, I thought I'd give a little bit of background on the kind of management organizations I've been a part of. The majority of my work experience has been first in large physics collaborations and then in the tech industry.

I'll briefly describe the two different management structures and then compare them a little bit.

## Tech Industry

I currently work at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) in what's called the AI organization ("org" for short). AI is a subset of the Data org, which in turn is part of Engineering.

Projects I work on mostly relate to the professional network, so while we work closely with engineers that work on either services powering [www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com) or the site itself, our lowest common ancestor on the org chart is still the LinkedIn's head of Engineering.

Within the orgs I'm familiar with at LinkedIn, there's a fairly stereotypical management hierarchy. At the bottom are the workers, who report to Managers. Managers report to Senior Managers, then Directors, Senior Directors, Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents. Within engineering orgs, most managers have direct reports who are individual contributors (ICs) even at the higher management levels. In a lot of cases these are senior ICs who provide technical guidance on projects with a larger scope.

From my point of view, a given project has stakeholders from three orgs: Product Management, Engineering, and AI. Each of these orgs has their own independent management chains. Therefore, it's generally up to low-level managers and ICs to reach alignment because there's no shared manager in the management chain until almost the top of the company.

We generally reach agreement among ourselves about what are the most important things to work on and how to accomplish them, but there can always be tasks which are priorities for other teams or higher level management that are assigned. And so we have to work on those because we might get bad performance reviews (and therefore bad/no raises/bonuses) if we don't.

## Big Physics

Before I worked in the tech industry, I worked in the [STAR](https://www.star.bnl.gov/) and [CMS](https://cms.cern/) collaborations, which at approximately 700 and 4000 members, respectively, are two of the largest scientific collaborations in the world.

As a graduate student or post-doctoral researcher working in one of these collaborations, you are generally associated with a university or national lab research group, meaning a faculty member or senior scientist is your boss.

However, the collaborations have their own internal management structures, which are broadly split into two areas: Detector and Analysis. Detector teams focus on issues related to operating, maintaining, and upgrading the physical detector. Analysis teams focus on testing theories against the data collected. Most papers produced by the collaboration are written by Analysis teams.

Most people will do work for teams on both sides. Faculty guide which teams their groups work with. For example, when I was a graduate student on the STAR collaboration, I worked with Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) and Software and Computing teams, which would fall on the Detector side, and the Spin team on the analysis side.

Each team is facilitated by a pair of convenors, who usually have staggered 2 year terms, so there's always one new convenor and one returning convenor. The level of management above them, is usually someone with a title containing "coordinator." In CMS, there were more finely divided teams, which were headed by a pair of sub-convenors.

Management practices in large physics experiments are so unique, there is actually scientific literature devoted to their study (see [here](https://espace.cern.ch/ATLAS-Sociology/Shared%20Documents/Master's%20thesis%20Jenni%20Hyppola.pdf) and [here](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9781786341389_0006)). One of the key characteristics is that managers within the collaboration hierarchies have no formal power over their team members. They have no power to hire, fire, perform annual reviews, give raises, or, even, to any real extent, tell people what to work on!

To give some concrete examples, when I worked at CMS, I was mainly part of the Tracker detector group and the SUSY analysis group (but I also contributed to several other groups). As part of my work in the Tracker group, I can't recall that I ever worked with anyone from my university, and there was certainly nobody in the management chain with any direct connection to my paycheck. Work in this group, and I assume most other detector groups, got done on a "if we don't do this, nothing will work" basis. So there was a strong incentive to contribute to the communal resource - a correctly working detector.

In the SUSY group, there was at one point a faculty member from my university in a convenor position. But because she was not my boss personally, she couldn't direct my research projects, and that was only one term. In fact, it was common in the analysis groups for multiple university teams to try to work on the same project without any coordination.

If you're wondering why things are set up that way, remember that these collaborations are made up of people from dozens of countries and hundreds of universities. And historically, faculty have been very autonomous in setting their own direction. So it's probably just not reasonable to expect that they would sign on to a much more structured management system.

## Comparison and conclusions
In contrast to the tech industry, and I assume, many businesses, big physics management relies to a much larger extent on "soft" power. Since managers have no direct control over their team members, they have to rely on indirect means to achieve their objectives. Certainly having good relationships is of high importance - many things are decided by committee, including funding priorities and hiring decisions, so it's a good idea to have good relationships with lots of people. You will often need a broad basis of support to accomplish major programs.

That's not to say soft power has no place in business. Certainly, most projects require multiple teams coming into alignment, which is a lot easier when strong working relationships are in place. But in the business world, there is always the fall-back of escalating the decision making to a higher power who can rule in favor of one side or the other.

There are clearly pros and cons to both approaches. In the scientific model, people have a lot more agency as they have a lot more control over their own agenda and there is a lot of resiliency because even if some people work on projects which don't work out, other people work on projects that do and the collaboration as a whole makes progress. On the other hand, resources are not allocated efficiently in the scientific collaboration. With stronger coordination, probably a lot more could be accomplished.

In the management model of business, clearly the system should be much more efficient and make progress at a much faster rate. However, there is a risk that the decision makers are not good, which prevents the organization as a whole from realizing its potential.
